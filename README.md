# Overview

==Student Gradebook Project==

This project was created to study and learn Java programming language and develop my own method for learning programming languages.

**Description of the software**

The goal is to create an application capable of storing student data for a course or school. The data the program should store includes: name, ID, and achieved score. It should be able to calculate the sum of grades and verify whether the student passed or failed, having a minimum passing score set at 60 points. Furthermore, it should be able to organize the ranking of student scores and return this ranking starting with the student who had the highest score. The program should be able to generate a CSV file for the end user to review the list.
